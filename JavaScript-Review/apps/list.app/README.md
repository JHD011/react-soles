## Setting Up a Web Server
We will be using live-server to set up a web server for local development. Download it with the following command

`npm install -g live-server`

You can then create a local web page with the following command:

`live-server <path-to-folder>`

Live-server is extremely useful, as you can make changes and have your local web page update automatically.
