# JavaScript Review

This section will serve as a crash course on JavaScript!

## Running files in the terminal

To run files in the terminal, run `node <file name>`.

## Assignment

Inside the functions, objects, arrays, and advanced folders, you will find exercise files. There is also a mini assignment in the list.app folder in which you have to implement a clear options button. Please submit a pull request for each of the exercise files, and one pull request for the changes made in list.app. If you don't know how to do a pull request or what they are, take a look at this [pull request tutorial](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/). I will be reviewing each pull request and seeing if there are any errors. I will comment `finished` on the pull requests that are completed. A main goal for this course is to give you a taste of the software development cycle as well. Contact Nico Magana if you have any questions!
