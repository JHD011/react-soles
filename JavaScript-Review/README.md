# JavaScript Review

This section will serve as a crash course on JavaScript!

## Running files in the terminal

To run files in the terminal, run `node <file name>`.

## Assignment

Inside the functions, objects, arrays, and advanced folders, you will find exercise files. There is also a mini assignment in the list.app folder in which you have to implement a clear options button. Please submit a pull request for each of the exercise files, and one pull request for the changes made in list.app. If you don't know how to do a pull request or what they are, take a look at this [pull request tutorial](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/). Contact Nico Magana if you have any questions!
