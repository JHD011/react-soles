# Lesson 1: String Basics

# You create variables in JavaScript by using let
let color = 'blue'

# Following line is used to output to the console
console.log(color)

# Now that thisVariable is declared, you can reassign without using let
color = 'green'
console.log(color)

let food = 'eggs and ham'

# Variables can be created by concatenating variables and string literals
let myOrder = 'I want ' + color + ' ' + food + ' please!'
console.log(myOrder)
