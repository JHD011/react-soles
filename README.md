Welcome to the React Tech @ SOLES course! Below you will find helpful links to help set up your environment and a tentative course schedule for the quarter!

# Environment Setup
## Visual Studio Code 
If you already have a source-code editor of preference, feel free to continue using it. If you don't have one, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com). 
## Node.js
Node.js will allow you to run JavaScript files. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
## cmder (Terminal Emulator for Windows)
If you are running Windows, install cmder to avoid using Window's wack console) [Download here](http://cmder.net).
